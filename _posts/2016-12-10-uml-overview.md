## Goals of UML

*A picture is worth a thousand words*, this absolutely fits while discussing about UML. 

At the conclusion the goal of UML can be defined as a simple modeling mechanism to model all possible practical systems in today.s complex environment.

​    

## Object Oriented Concepts:

UML is powerful enough to represent all the concepts exists in object oriented analysis and design.

- **Objects:** Objects represent an entity and the basic building block.
- **Class:** Class is the blue print of an object.
- **Abstraction:** Abstraction represents the behavior of an real world entity.
- **Encapsulation:** Encapsulation is the mechanism of binding the data together and hiding them from outside world.
- **Inheritance:** Inheritance is the mechanism of making new classes from existing one.
- **Polymorphism:** It defines the mechanism to exists in different forms.

   

The purpose of OO analysis and design can described as:

- Identifying the objects of a system.
- Identify their relationships.
- Make a design which can be converted to executables using OO languages.

​    

Three basic steps where the OO concepts are applied and implemented

***OO Analysis --> OO Design --> OO implementation using OO languages***

- OO analysis:  identify objects and describing them in a proper way. 
-  OO design. During this phase emphasis is given upon the requirements and their fulfilment. In this stage the objects are collaborated according to their intended association. After the association is complete the design is also complete.
- OO implementation



# BuildingBlocks

- Things
- Relationships
- Diagrams

## Things

- Structural (**Structural things** define the static part of the model)
  - class、interface、collaboration、use case、component、node
- Behavioral (**A behavioral thing** consists of the dynamic parts of UML models）
  - interaction、state machine
- Grouping (**Grouping things** can be defined as a mechanism to group elements of a UML model together. )
  - Package
- Annotational (**Annotational things** can be defined as a mechanism to capture remarks, descriptions, and comments of UML model elements. **Note** is the only one Annotational thing available.)

## Relationships

**Relationship** is another most important building block of UML. It shows how elements are associated with each other and this association describes the functionality of an application.

There are four kinds of relationships available.

- Dependency

Dependency is a relationship between two things in which change in one element also affects the other one.

- Association:

Association is basically a set of links that connects elements of an UML model. It also describes how many objects are taking part in that relationship.

- Generalization:

It basically describes inheritance relationship in the world of objects.

- Realization:

One element describes some responsibility which is not implemented and the other one implements them. This relationship exists in case of interfaces.
