Hey yall, I am Yang!

I' m from *Shanghai, China* and currently studying ands living in *Los Angeles*.

So this is a bit about me.

I got my **Bachelor of Software Engineering** degree at Xiamen University. Xiamen University is a dream unviersity for millions of students in China. It is both academically competitive and famous for its super large and beatiful campus. XMU is actually ***the*** most beautiful university in Mainland China (Wuhan University may not agree with that, but just admit it, XMU is prettier).

I love exploring new things and pursuing better educational opportunities, that is why I went on two one-semester exchange programs and chose to do ***Master of Computer Science*** degree at University of Southern California.

A lot of people say USC is unsafe, but I think USC stacks up pretty well. School provides a lot of safety services, such as DPS(Department of Public Safety), Patrol Zones, Free Lyft, Self Defense Training,etc. And shout out to ***USC village*** ! Now I guess everyone knows why our tuition and insurance fee is sooo expensive :)  Still, I hope I can live to the day I graduate from USC. 

Speaking of my major, my interest is **data science** and **web development**. It is a data-driven society. We probably can say who discover the true value of data, who makes money; A **website** is now a necessity for a business, whatever big or small, and more and more people are trying to build their own sites to share their works or ideas. See, no reason to be not interested in either field.
