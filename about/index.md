Hey yall!

I' Yang, and I' m from Shanghai, China.

So this is a bit about me.

I got my **Bachelor of Software Engineering** degree at Xiamen University, the most beautiful university in Mainland China (Wuhan University may not agree with that, but just admit it, XMU is prettier).

I love exploring new things and pursuing better educational opportunities, that is why I went on two one-semester exchange programs and chose to do ***Master of Computer Science*** degree at University of Southern California.
